# FUT-Dashboard
This is a dashboard that is live on a Python Anywhere server that gives a view of the FIFA 2020 video game mode called Ultimate Team.

This game mode contains thousands of soccer players with individual statistics, and prices over time creating a market. With this in mind I created a dashboard to show the following:

Descriptive Statistics: Shows different graphics about general statistics in the game such as number of players that prefer the right or left foot, players by position, etc.

Player Search Database: A search table that can query any player player by any attribute in the game including age, price, in-game attribute, height, etc.

Market Index Analysis: I created a market index for the Ultimate Team 2020 player market where we can see the market as a whole, Rating, Card Type, League and Club.

Player Information: Gives the statistics of every player in the game along with their price over time and their index over time.

ML Pricing Algorithm: An algorithm that will predict the prices of any player in the game up to 30 days in the future.
